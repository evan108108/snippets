Some scripts to test using threads with WWW::Mechanize

Run generate_linkfile.rb before running thread_mech or the compare script.

It will search google for a random word from /usr/share/dict/words.  Change the
dictionary location if it is somewhere else.

You can run it multiple times to make the link list grow larger.  Delete the
file xlinks.yml to start over with no links.

You can then run the comparision script or thread_mech.rb directly.

You can pass rand at the end of the other options to thread_mech.rb to randomly
choose sites from the link file.  compare will randomize for you so no need to
include the option when running compare.

Example

  ruby generate_linkfile.rb
  ruby compare_1.8_to_1.9.rb

  or

  ruby generate_linkfile.rb
  ruby thread_mech.rb xlinks.yml 24

  or

  ruby generate_linkfile.rb
  ruby thread_mech.rb xlinks.yml 24 rand
