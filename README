Snippets of code to demonstrate various things. Some of these are just for fun
and should not be used in "real code."  Take what you see with a grain of salt.
Other things such as the add_lib_path are showing how to solve a real problem
in a succinct way.

Of course some of these code samples are overly verbose and completely
unfactored.  Usually that was to show all of the steps including lots of
variables which would probably not be used in "real code."

Have fun! :)
